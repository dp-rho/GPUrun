Description: Interprets and compiles basic R expressions operating on vectors and matrices using machine generated CUDA code in combination with included C++ code.  The compiled objects are linked and loaded into the R session as an .so object via Rcpp's package building infastructure.  These compiled commands can then be evaluated in parallel any number of times using an NVIDIA GPU.
